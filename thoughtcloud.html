                <p> Since this is an early stage start up, I got the opportunity to contribute to the product from the very beginning which taught me a lot about turning business ideas and insights from user research into production ready user interfaces through the entire design thinking cycle.<br> I also learned how to build a design system from scratch applying principles of accessibility while keeping the brand's identity as the focus. I also did this in a team environment with constant collaboration with the CEO. This help me improve my skills as an effective team member.</p>
