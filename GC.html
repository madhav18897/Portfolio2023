                <h2>What Does <span>GameChanger</span> Do?</h2>
                <p>GameChanger provides mobile and web platforms that offer live scoring, stats, and streaming for youth and amateur sports teams, enabling players, coaches, and families to stay connected and engaged. For this project I worked with the team focused on furthering the success of the Volleyball offering at GC.</p>

                        <h1>The Context</h1>
                        <h2>What I Worked On</h2>
                        <p>This project began as a UI exploration to improve discoverability of the new Film Room feature for volleyball teams, enabling staff to analyze footage, mark key moments, and share them with others. We focused on small UI elements, like banners and tooltips, to address its hard-to-find placement across multiple tabs and beneath other content.</p>

                        <h1>The Design Process</h1>
                        <h2>The Triple Diamond</h2>
                        <p>The Triple Diamond model is an extended design framework that builds on the Double Diamond approach. It includes three phases: Discover (research to understand the problem), Define (clarify and focus on a specific challenge), and Develop and Deliver (ideate, prototype, and implement solutions). The third diamond,Impact, emphasizes measuring outcomes and refining based on user feedback, creating a continuous cycle of improvement.</p>

                <h2>Just another day spent exploring</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">This project began as a UI exploration to draw attention to the newly launched Film Room feature, helping volleyball team staff analyze footage, mark key moments, and share them with players, coaches, or parents. We focused on small UI elements, like banners and tooltips, to address discoverability challenges, hypothesizing that the feature’s placement within multiple tabs and under other content made it hard to find.</p>

                <p>We chose a simple, dismissable blue banner from existing design components to highlight the Film Room feature with minimal development effort.

                            2. Intuitiveness: Assess if the design and placement of the video tab naturally draw coaches’ attention, and whether they can easily find and use the Film Room.<br><br>
                            3. Navigation: Track the pathways coaches take to access the Film Room and identify any usability issues, such as unclear labels or hidden options.<br><br>
                            4. Interaction: Determine if coaches understand how to access the Film Room by interacting with the video archive tiles without additional labels.<br><br>
                            5. Satisfaction: Measure coaches' satisfaction with the ease of discovering and using the Film Room within the app (Score out of 5). </p>

                <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
                <p>To address our research questions, we’ll conduct an unmoderated usability test with volleyball coaches aged 35-50 who coach 11-16U teams, sourced from the Userbrain database. The study will include both GameChanger users and non-users, with screening to ensure relevant coaching experience.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: #00d682;"> Our target group is 11-16U club coaches, because live streaming is essential to product-market fit in this segment, and efficient game footage analysis supports team performance improvement. Coaches favor an all-in-one solution for reviewing, giving feedback, and sharing videos. By streamlining access to these features, GameChanger can strengthen its competitive advantage</h2>
                </div>

                <h2 style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">Scope</h2>
                <p>We’re focusing on improving the discoverability of Film Room within the current information architecture (IA), without making structural changes. Since the feature is already live, we’ll conduct usability testing to observe how users locate it. If findings indicate the need, we may consider IA changes or follow up with an in-app A/B test.</p>

                <h2>The Test</h2>
                <p> I set up a usability test on the user brain platform in accordance with the screening criteria we had for participants.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>This usability test evaluated how easily youth volleyball coaches could navigate the GameChanger app to find and use the game footage analysis feature.</p>

We should focus on directing users to the correct tab and then encourage them to click on the correct tile using UI elements.</span> <br><br>
                            The video tab on the team home page, marked by a red dot and banner, effectively drew attention as the main entry point. Although the Beta tag was well-placed, additional information could be helpful. Users suggested making the video tab the default, but further research was needed.</p>

                        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                        <p>• Consider alternative Beta badge placements, add a blue banner to guide users to the video tab, note existing footage (or upload instructions) on the info page, and conduct a Kubit analysis to track post-game visits, supporting a case for making the video tab default.
                            <br><br>• Future improvements: link play-by-play events to Film Room with short clips for marking and add video status to the schedule tile.</p>

                <p>One thing that was made really apparent from this test was that there is a need for an easier and faster entry point into film room. After some brainstorming, we came to the realization the best way to do this would be through a widget on the home screen, which can take coaches and staff directly into film room shortly after a game has ended. I started doing some explorations for the same. </p>

                            • Are coaches creating clips or assigning timestamps, and which moments are prioritized as coachable? <br>
                            • How are scores and plays noted during analysis, and what tools and devices are commonly used? <br>
                            • When do coaches typically analyze footage? <br>
                            • How are insights shared, and what specific improvements do coaches see as a result of game analysis?</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">We learned from the Film Room Discoverability Usability Test, that there is additional need to improve discoverability (scored 3.8/5), and this can be improved with UI elements to guide users to Film Room. A potential solution we are interested in exploring is a home screen widget.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">The test also gave us a key insight that users are entering Film Room from the most easily viewed/obvious entry point. The home screen widget takes this a step further as it is likely to be the first thing the user sees when they open the app.</p>

                        <p> After several explorations, I chose this design as it clearly conveys key details: the CTA, score, thumbnail, and marked moments count. It aligns with the existing game widget in our design system and builds on past success with home screen widgets.

                        <p><span style="color: #121212; font-weight: bold;">The Film Room widget is well-placed, attention-grabbing, and meets user expectations, making the test a success. The CTA copy and UI elements are effective, but other entry points need clearer highlighting for better discoverability.</span> <br><br>
                            Users found the "Analyze in Film Room" button intuitive and well-placed, with clear language enhancing feature understanding.

                        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                        <p>• Maintain the clear, action-oriented language around the CTA across all Film Room touchpoints. <br>
                            • Adjust the widget timing to 48 hours post-game, aligning with coaches' typical review period of 1-3 days. <br>
                            • Additionally, implement quick onboarding or tooltips for first-time users to help them navigate and utilize all available features effectively.
