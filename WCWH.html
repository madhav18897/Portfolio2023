                <p>Families engaged in the research use the app Hornsense to understand the data that is summarized from their Fitbit bands and environmental sensors. They are given the information so they may decide on their health and living conditions with awareness. However, the app's structure is difficult to understand, and the data currently given on it lacks sufficient context.</p>

                <p>When we started to perform Competitor Analysis, we chose 6 competitors - 3 direct and 3 indirect. Direct competitors were those businesses that offered similar products or services to another company within the same market while indirect competitors were those that served the same customer needs as another company but offered different products or services. </p>

                        <p style="margin-top: -12px;">Since our app is a research-based initiative, it cannot be a paid service so even after scaling it up, marginalized communities can continue to have access to it.</p>
        
                        <h2>2. Easily understandable graphs</h2>
                        <p style="margin-top: -12px;">Complex graphs can overwhelm the user and cause them to lose interest in using the application.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: -12px;">Text-heavy content increases the cognitive load on the users and thus may distract them while using the application. Thus, to increase app engagement we have incorporated visually appealing and easily comprehensible content.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: -12px;">As observed from the analysis, the Information Architecture should support easy discoverability of features. Thus, we have designed our dashboard such that it is easy to navigate through the app home screen.</p>
            
                        <h2>5. Avoiding panic</h2>
                        <p style="margin-top: -12px;">The health-related in-app notifications should not create panic, but should convey the information effectively.</p>

                <p>We saw this as a great opportunity to work with marginalized communities, albeit indirectly, while sharpening our own skills as students of Information Architecture.

                <p>We compiled a list of the most important questions we asked our user representatives and based on their answers, we came up with a task list that we used during the user interviews we performed with our users.</p>

                    <p>2. Only 40% of our user groups were college graduates as for the rest of our users, they had limited access to academic assistance. So, we focused on designing a system that was easy to understand.</p>

                <p>To gather all the data together in a place, we started to put data together in the content inventory which we designed in Excel. Doing so helped us get all the data present on the existing Hornsense app together in one place and we also found out what is there on the app and how it is structured. It also helped us identify the content that was not up to date.</p>

                <p>Once we had analyzed our content, we moved forward to designing the Information Architecture for the app. To do this, we started with card sorting. This process helped us interact with our users and get their insights on the various topics in the app and how they would like to view them under different categories. We used the Maze software to carry out the task. We conducted closed card sorting with a total of 12 participants, with 23 cards to be categorized into 9 categories.</p>

                <p>Using this technique, our team was able to observe in the visual form how frequently people concur that a particular card belongs in each category using the agreement matrix. This table shows the most popular groups of cards for each category based on where participants placed the cards most often.</p>

                <p>This is a straightforward illustration of paired possibilities. This provided us with an understanding of which cards our participants frequently matched together in the same group. The more frequently two cards were paired together by your participants, the darker the purple color where the two cards overlap. This table shows the most closely related pairs of cards, which are grouped on the right edge of the table based on how often participants sorted any two cards into the same category.</p>

                    <li class="inner-list-item">We started out with a project proposal for the WCWH team and then proceeded to define our goals, assess our competitors and draw useful insights from the study. We next took steps to comprehend our users' problems before creating user personas to represent our user group. Following this, we created affinity maps and drew out the concept map for the already-existing app to comprehend the logic behind the flow and prepare the content inventory. As soon as we got a firm grasp on this, we started brainstorming ideas for the new information architecture and utilized card sorting to choose the app's labeling. During this time, we also created our new concept map.</li>
                    <li class="inner-list-item">Following the Ideation phase, we developed our lo-fi, and hi-fi designs before putting our interactive prototype together. During this step, we brainstormed about the various visuals we could use to reflect the health data back to the users.</li>
                    <li class="inner-list-item">We explored throughout the project to see how various information architectures would work with our design model and how the various navigational options affected the usability of the app. The entire approach has helped us understand the value of and how to build and design in a constrained environment.</li>
