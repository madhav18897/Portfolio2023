                <h1>Problem Exploration</h1>
                <p>The traditional movie theatre experience has faced significant challenges in recent times, exacerbated by factors such as changing consumer preferences, technological advancements, and unforeseen circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges include:</p>
                <h2>1. Accessibility and Convenience:</h2>
                <p> Many moviegoers find it inconvenient to travel to theatres, especially considering factors like distance, traffic, and time constraints. Additionally, unforeseen circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the need for alternative viewing options that prioritise safety and comfort.</p>

                <h2>2. Social Engagement</h2>
                <p>Despite the inherent social aspect of movie-watching, traditional theatres often fail to facilitate meaningful social interactions, particularly for viewers separated by physical distance.</p>

                <h2>3. Culinary Experience</h2>
                <p>While theatres offer concessions, the variety and quality of food options may not always meet the expectations of discerning audiences. Additionally, the process of ordering and receiving food physically during screenings can disrupt the viewing experience.</p>

                <h2>4. Flexibility of Viewing Options</h2>
                <p>The rigid scheduling of theatrical showtimes may not align with the preferences and schedules of all moviegoers, leading to missed opportunities for engagement.

                    Addressing these challenges is crucial to not only sustain the movie theater industry but also to enhance the overall movie-watching experience for audiences.</p>

By offering the Alamo Drafthouse VR Experience, viewers can enjoy movies from the comfort of their own homes, eliminating the need for travel and overcoming geographical barriers.</p>

                <h2>2. Social Connection:</h2>
                <p>Through virtual watch parties, our aim is to foster social connections and shared experiences among movie enthusiasts. By enabling friends to watch movies together in a virtual environment, we capitalize on the inherent social aspect of movie-watching, regardless of physical distance.</p>

                <h2>3. Culinary Indulgence:</h2>
                <p>Integrating Alamo's signature menu into the VR experience presents an opportunity to enhance the culinary aspect of movie-watching. By offering a diverse selection of high-quality food and beverage options, we aim to elevate the overall viewing experience and cater to the preferences of discerning audiences.</p>

                <h2>4. Flexibility and Convenience:</h2>
                <p>By providing both 72-hour rental and live showing formats, we aim to cater to the diverse preferences and schedules of moviegoers. This flexibility not only expands our potential audience but also maximizes convenience, ensuring that viewers can enjoy movies on their own terms.
                In pursuing these goals, we not only address existing challenges within the movie theatre industry but also unlock new business opportunities by tapping into the growing demand for innovative and immersive entertainment experiences.</p>

                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>Based on the Problem exploration and discovery phase, we divided our problem statement into 4 segments to better understand and tackle the problem</p>

                <h2>Who</h2>
                <p>Loyal customers of Alamo Drafthouse and movie enthusiasts, as well as VR enthusiasts, face challenges accessing theaters and engaging in immersive movie experiences.</p>

                <h2>What</h2>
                <p>These challenges include limited accessibility, frustrations with the theater environment, high costs, transportation difficulties, and conflicts with inflexible work and personal schedules.</p>

                <h2>When</h2>
                <p>These issues are particularly prevalent when new movies release in physical theaters, exacerbating the obstacles faced by movie-goers.</p>

                <h2>Why</h2>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h1>Design Process</h1>
                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>Our initial ideation involved mapping out a user journey to seamlessly integrate the new VR feature into Alamo Drafthouse’s existing app.

                    Understanding user needs at every step, we individually crafted unique versions of the journey by drawing insights from research. We then merged these to create a central flow aimed at optimizing the user experience.
                    
                    Additionally, we visually represented task flows of the app’s current state and new flow to mimic the app’s functionality and also pinpoint the exact user path.</p>

                <h2>Crazy 8s</h2>
                <p>We employed the dynamic Crazy 8s exercise to tackle our design challenge collaboratively.

                    Each team member embarked on a rapid ideation journey, sketching eight unique concepts in just eight minutes.
                    
                    We tried to sketch the entire flow/parts of the flow, in as much detail a possible in order to understand the requirements for the first wireframes we would design.
                    
                    We then voted on the features we liked the most in each other’s sketches.</p>

                <p>Based on the sketches we did as part of our crazy eight exercise we narrowed down some key features which would be important to include in the wireframes.

                    After we made the wireframes, we appear critique of the wire frames amongst our own group and came up with some interesting corrections which could be made to the wire frame before concept testing.</p> 

                <h1>Wireframing</h1> 
                <p>Based on the previous exercises, we came up with some wireframes which were then used for concept testing and peer critique to improve the product moving forward.</p>

                <h2>VR Wireframes</h2>

                <h1 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Concept Testing</h1>
                <p>After peer testing and iterations on the initial wireframes based on the peer critique, our team started with the process of concept testing which helped us get a direction moving forward.</p>

                <h2>Positive Feedback</h2>
                <p>• Users thought the concept is a really good idea.
                    • The social aspect of watching movies together was highly appreciated.
                    • The concept was seen as very different from traditional movie watching.</p>

                <h2>Confusion and Questions</h2>
                <p>• Users were confused about the purpose of certain buttons and features.
                    • The friend selection process was confusing.
                    • Users were unsure about the difference between watching a movie and connecting to VR.
                    • Some users didn't understand the purpose of the “cooldown room”.</p>

                <h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
                <p>• Users suggested thinking more about concessions and making the process clearer.
                    • Some users recommended adding a reminder notice for ordering food.
                    • Users wanted clearer instructions on how to use VR and enhance the VR experience.
                    • Users suggested making the VR button more noticeable.</p>
